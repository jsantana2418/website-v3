Code Correction

In this video, the selector :nth-child(4n) is used to correct a responsive issue on every 4th item. In other words, this will select the 4th item, 8th item, 12th item, and so on. This fixes the specific problem in the video, but if more gallery items are added beyond the 5 that are present in this project, the design will start to break again. That's because there are 3 items in each row, and every 4th item could appear at the beginning, middle, or end of a row.

Instead, we want to select the first item in each row. A more robust solution is to use the selector :nth-child(3n + 1) instead. This will select every 3rd item plus 1. In other words, this will select the 4th item, 7th item, 10th item, and so on.

CSS Properties

border - CSS shorthand property that allows for a visual outline or "border" to be applied to an element. Accepts a length unit to define the border-width, a keyword to define the border-style, and a color unit for the border-color.
